# About Project
This is a simple Data Science projects that is build for predict diamond price depends on some charastics of diamond.

At first I perform statistical analysis on this dataset and clean and visualize this dataset using popular python library such as <b>Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn etc</b>

In second step,I build a model using <b>KNN which located on sklearn library </b> using <a href="https://github.com/farhad06/Projects/tree/main/Diammond/data">this</a> dataset.

In the 3rd step, I create a website using <b>Streamlit</b> where users can upload their requirement to know price.
