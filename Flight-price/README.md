# Project Title

#### Flight Price Prediction

# Project Description

This data science project walks through step by step process of how to build a flight price prediction website. We will first build a model using <b> sklearn and Random Forest</b> and using <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-n-sfk4dVsWLQww2mfC0ZhFHBKYhuuVk?usp=sharing">this</a>dataset . Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter time,date,source,destination,ariways and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineng etc using <b> Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib.
