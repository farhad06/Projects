# About Project
This is an Image classification-based project which is created to predict whether a person is covid positive or normal using his/her X-ray image.

At first,I build a model using <b>CNN , Keras and Tensorflow </b> using <a href="http://cb.lk/covid_19">this</a> dataset.

In the second step, I create a website using <b>Streamlit</b> where users can upload their X-ray images to know he/she is covid positive or normal.
